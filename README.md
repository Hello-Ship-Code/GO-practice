# Go Practice Projects 🚀

Welcome to my **Go (Golang) Practice Repository**!  
This is where I learn, explore, and build demo projects using Go — starting from basics and gradually diving into more advanced concepts.

---

## 📘 What You’ll Find Here

- ✅ Simple Go programs to understand syntax and core concepts.
- 📂 Organized into folders by topic or project.
- 💡 Real-world mini-projects as I grow in Go.

---

## 📁 Structure

```bash
go-practice/
├── 01-hello-world/
│   └── main.go
├── 02-variables/
│   └── variables.go
├── 03-functions/
│   └── sum.go
├── 04-user-input/
│   └── input.go
├── README.md
```

Each folder focuses on one topic or concept with a single entry-point (`main.go`) or a focused file.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered (So Far)

- ✅ Printing to console
- ✅ Declaring and using variables
- ✅ Functions and return values
- ✅ Taking user input
- ✅ Using packages and organizing code

More coming soon as I explore Go deeper!

## 🚀 Example Snippet

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func sum(a int, b int) int {
	return a + b
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello world")

	a, b := 1, 5
	result := sum(a, b)
	fmt.Println("The sum of", a, "+", b, "=", result)
}
```

## 🛠 Requirements

- Go installed (use `go version` to check)
- VS Code or any code editor
- (Optional) Go extension for VS Code for better experience

---

## 📌 Goals

- Build strong fundamentals in Go
- Practice clean code and project organization
- Prepare for real-world Go development

---

## 📅 Progress

I'm continuously updating this repo with:
- New topics
- Practice exercises
- Small Go utilities

Stay tuned 👨‍💻
